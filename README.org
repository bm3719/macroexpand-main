* macroexpand-main

The top-level site on [[https://macroexpand.com][macroexpand.com]].

This is a generated, static content site without anything too fancy in it.
I've made this public and GPL-ed, so you're welcome to borrow/modify the
design.

** Generating the site

This site uses Emacs Org mode to generate the HTML from an Org format file.  To
do the same, =cons= something like this to your =org-publish-project-alist=
variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
("main"
 :base-directory "~/src/macroexpand-main"
 :recursive nil
 :publishing-directory "~/src/macroexpand-main"
 :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
 :with-author nil
 :with-broken-links t
 :with-creator nil
 :html-validation-link nil
 :html-postamble nil
 :html-preamble nil
 :exclude ".*"
 :include ["index.org"])
#+END_SRC

Then you can run =C-c C-e P p= when you're finished making updates and Emacs
will export the project to HTML.

** CSS theme

The CSS here is a fork of [[https://writ.cmcenroe.me/][writ]], an excellent minimal and CDN-available CSS
theme.  I changed it to add things like lines under headings, tweaked margin
settings, and some different colors.
