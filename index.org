* Macroexpand

Macroexpand, Inc. is a research/concept-stage software development company
headquartered in the great state of West Virginia.  Our current focus is on
data analytics and modeling in functional programming languages.  Given
existing functional programming ecosystems, a focus on the practical
applications of the higher-order abstractions possible within them is a
secondary priority.

The name Macroexpand comes from the [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mexp_.htm][function]] of the same name in ANSI Common
Lisp. This function is also implemented in other Lisp variants, including our
primary language of choice, Clojure.

* Services

** Freelance services

A subset of services available:
- If your corporation has a data analysis problem, Macroexpand knows how to
  extract meaning from it (assuming there is any).
- If your domain can be formalized and reasoned about, we can model it.  We
  have in-house specialization in the novel application of language theory,
  type theory (particularly dependent types), provably correct software, and
  automated theorem proving.
- General, temporary-CTO services, centering the development side of your
  business around functional programming, crafting a strategy for team
  migration/formation, full-spectrum theory-crafting, and similar assistance
  are available.

Preference on our end is for a service agreement composed of the delivery of
some whole number of work units, each equivalent to a weekly full-time effort.
These may or may not line up with calendar weeks, conditional on available
bandwidth.

** General business services

Also available are services related to technical writing, editing,
ghostwriting, and assistance with academic and industry papers.  A list of
projects completed by the company member providing these services is available
upon request.

** Seasonal produce and seeds

Most years, the location of our physical headquarters also produces and
abundance of fresh vegetables, fruit, eggs, and heirloom seeds.  These vary by
year and time of year.  If you're near Hampshire County, WV, arrangements can
be made for the purchase of produce, or the planting of extra for intended
future purchase.  Seeds can be mailed anywhere in the world.

We also have 2 custom-made and completely unique strains, with seeds available
for distribution.  Those are:
- The Bromato F4 (4th filial gen): A select cross-breeding of locally popular
  strains of cherry and slicer tomatoes.  Grows to about 1.5-2" in diameter.
  Starts producing early in the season and continues a consistent harvest all
  year.  A versatile size, great in salads and focaccia.  Very prolific.
- The MyThai F3 (3rd filial gen) pepper: A rare, random cross between Burpee's
  mini-Thai and early Jalapeño peppers, this 1-1.5" pepper ripens to a bright,
  uncorked red with medium wall thickness.  Retains full Thai pepper flavor.
  Heat levels are extreme for a Thai pepper, estimated roughly at 80000-100000
  SHU.  With proper pruning and care, can serve as an indoor ornamental pepper.

Check back here for the 2023 seed list, coming in Fall 2022.

A small orchard is in the process of being built and is hoped to be functional
before 2028 or so.

** Hunting

A single, spacious tree stand is available for rent, overlooking a ravine
popular for whitetail deer to travel through and good for a sub-100yd shot with
hunting revolver or bush rifle.  Bring chairs and blind material of your choice
for an easy day of hunting with the ability to use your electronic devices
while waiting.

Cost to book during buck firearms and doe seasons is $200/day.  Recommended
tree stand capacity is 1 or 2 persons.  A valid WV hunting license,
safe/ethical hunting behavior, and following all state hunting regulations are
strictly required.  Due to the location of property lines, we also reserve the
right to approve choice of chambering to minimize the inconvenience of quarry
requiring trailing across multiple properties.  Stand is not available for
muzzleloader or bow seasons, nor for any other game animal.
