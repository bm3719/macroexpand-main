* Macroexpand

Macroexpand, Inc. is a research/concept-stage software development company
headquartered in the great state of West Virginia.  Our current focus is on
data analytics and modeling in functional programming languages.  Given
existing functional programming ecosystems, a focus on the practical
applications of the higher-order abstractions possible within them is a
secondary priority.

The name Macroexpand comes from the [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mexp_.htm][function]] of the same name in ANSI Common
Lisp. This function is also implemented in other Lisp variants, including our
primary language of choice, Clojure.

* Services

** Data analytics

If your corporation has a data analysis problem, Macroexpand knows how to
extract meaning from it (assuming there is any).  Contact us to negotiate a
freelance contract.

** Full-spectrum theory-crafting

If your domain can be formalized and reasoned about, we can model it.  We have
in-house specialization in the novel application of language theory, type
theory (particularly dependent types), provably correct software, and automated
theorem proving.

** Hosting

If you'd like a shell account for low-throughput development or website
hosting, send an email via the contact info below.  No promises are made
regarding quality of service, however.
