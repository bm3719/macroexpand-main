* Macroexpand
Macroexpand, Inc. is a non-existent software development company headquartered
in the great state of West Virginia.  Our primary focus is on data analytics
and modeling in functional programming languages.  Given existing functional
programming ecosystems, a focus on the practical applications of the
higher-order abstractions possible within them is a secondary priority.

The name Macroexpand comes from the [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mexp_.htm][function]] of the same name in ANSI Common
Lisp. This function is also implemented in other Lisp variants, including our
primary language of choice, Clojure.
