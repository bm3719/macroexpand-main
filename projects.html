          Hardware resources available include this VPS, a FreeBSD workstation,
          and a Windows box.  Most of the upgrades here are complete, with only
          OS upgrades to the VPS and workstation remaining.  Following this,
          additional network services (including company email) will be
          deployed.
          <p>
            <span class="sub-item">VPS</span>: macroexpand.com is a
            RootBSD-hosted VPS, running FreeBSD 10.0-REL x64 on their "Iota"
            plan (512MB RAM, 20GB disk space, and 250GB/mo. bandwidth).  This
            server has been around since about 2000 in various incarnations,
            most recently as cellblock.homeunix.com (now defunct), and is also
            accessible as muze.x.rootbsd.net.

            <span class="sub-item">FreeBSD workstation</span>: The main
            development workstation and general usage machine (where this site
            was until recently hosted) runs FreeBSD 10.0-REL x64.  Normally,
            it'd still be hosted there, but our current ISP blocks outbound
            ports 80 and 443.

            This uses the xmonad WM to primarily manage urxvt terminals which
            run zsh shells and an emacs -nw session under GNU screen.  In Nov
            2009, this machine was rebuilt to use no moving parts and minimal
            power consumption.  Our primary exocortex currently consists of:

            This shares peripherals via KVM switch with the FreeBSD
