          Macroexpand normally sub-contracts for expertise not covered by our
          existing team, but if you happen to have a rare intersection of
          talent in our focus areas and a strong desire to get in on the ground
          floor of an exciting, fast-paced, high-technology startup,
          arrangements can be made to accommodate additional personnel.
          <p>
            Note that at the current time, full-time team members are not
            receiving regular, employee-style stipends.  For all non-volunteer
            work, completed contract emolument is divided proportionally by
            participation.  Furthermore, the majority of our efforts are
            centered around research and exploratory prototyping.  Macroexpand
            is a (pre-)early-stage startup, not a corporate employer.
          </p>
          <ul class="nav-list">
            <li><span class="sub-item">Statistician</span>: Macroexpand is
              currently in the market for a candidate with a broad practical or
              theoretical statistical background, preferably with application to
              data analysis.<p /></li>
            <li><span class="sub-item">Corporate Liaison</span>: As Macroexpand
              currently acts as a corporate entity from which freelance contracts
              can be brokered, a liaison role interacting with other corporations
              or government entities can significantly boost our contract
              throughput.<p /></li>
            <li><span class="sub-item">Unpaid Internships</span>: Students and
              others looking to build experience in our focus areas are welcome
              to volunteer time with no running obligations.  Of course,
              Macroexpand reserves to the right to unilaterally terminate
              relationships if the cost outweighs the benefit.<p /></li>
